# Anki-Cards

This is a list of anki decks that I have made for the classes that I currently am studying for.

Edrivetour is actually an Erasmus Plus program with its main focus on electric vehicles and the Edrivetour-Phase1 deck is on the matter of Automotive Marketing,
Sustainable Transportation, Life Cycle Assessment of EVs, Smart Grids, EV public policies and EV production management.

The second deck is based on information provided by the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.
